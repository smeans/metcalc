# metcalc
Metcalc is a very simple metric calculator built using the [pegjs](http://pegjs.org/) parser generator. The grammar constructs a parse tree for simple arithmetic expressions then evaluates them. The only difference from most other calculators is that numbers can have a suffix that determines their magnitude.
